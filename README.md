# raspare (WIP)
visual programming

## Why
Sometimes the tools I use either use a lot of memory or is very slow (or both) so why not make my own. What could go wrong, right?

## Examples
```clojure
(def width 1280)
(def height 720)

(canvas width height)

;; str -> image
;; (img-load path)
;; image -> Method -> num -> num -> image
;;   Method: 'bilinear 'nearest
;; (img-resize image method w h)
;; image -> image -> Method
;;   Method: 'normal 'multiply 'overlay 'screen
;; (img-mix bg fg method)
;; image -> nil
;; (img-render image)

(def gradient
  (-> (img-load   "examples/assets/grad_b2w_100x100.png")
      (img-resize 'bilinear width height)
      ))

(def image
  (-> (img-load   "examples/assets/azur_atramenta.jpg")
      (img-resize 'bilinear width height)
      (img-mix    gradient 'multiply)
      ))

(img-render image)
```
